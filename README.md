# Binary-Search-Tree
A Binary search tree is not a normal tree. Normal trees don't have any rules.
Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following rules:
- Rule 1 - The value of left node must be smaller than the parent node, and the value of right node must be greater than the parent node.
- Rule 2 - The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
- Rule 3 - A tree having a right subtree with one value smaller than the root is shown to demonstrate that it is not a valid binary search tree.

## Basic Operation
Search - Searches an element in a tree.
Insert - Inserts an element in a tree.
Pre-order Traversal - Traverses a tree in a pre-order manner.
In-order Traversal - Traverses a tree in an in-order manner.
Post-order Traversal - Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.
